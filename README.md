# Math-Simulations
I often come across various interesting probability/counting math problems. I've always loved these problems because I can write code to verify that my solutions are correct. These probability simulations simply involve running a scenario a lot of times (about 10^6) and determining the percentage in which the conditions are satisfied. 

Some of these mathematical problems are fairly challenging, but the program spits out answers without much difficulty. For each problem in this repository, there will be a paper that solves the problem mathematically, and a simulation that I coded that solves it numerically.
